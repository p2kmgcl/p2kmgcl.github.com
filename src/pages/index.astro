    I am a developer who <strong>loves his job</strong>, aims for continuous
    learning, and is not afraid of learning from his mistakes. I have developed
    code for native interfaces, mobile interfaces and server-side execution but,
    without the slightest doubt, <strong>Front-End</strong>
    development is my main motivation as professional.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a proficient <strong>Linux user</strong>, not only due to the comfort
    it gives to developers but also it's open and free nature. I like to support <strong
      >Open Source</strong
    > software: I consider it a great path for improvement, and a fantastic way to
    let others grow too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Working as part of a team feels the ideal situation for me. Although I can
    evolve fast by my own, I <strong>prefer to work together</strong> with great
    people to learn from, so we can get new skills from each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do <strong>like clean code</strong>, well-defined structure, and crystal
    clear documentation. I am <strong>meticulous</strong>, and I apply this
    behaviour to my projects: everytime I am able to, I like to apply generic
    solutions, like design patterns, and I put lots of effort to make the final
    product simple, legible and reusable.
