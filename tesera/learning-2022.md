### Intro to Kubernetes (June 7th)

I have been reading [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
and followed some basic tutorials to understand what is that about. As I
understood, Kubernetes is a whole ecosystem for container-based system
administration, including deployment, escalation and resource management. I
thought this was a Google-owned project, but that is only true until 2014, when
they made it free (smart movement, as usual, because know they host kubernetes
in their paid cloud service).

Focusing on Kubernetes as a platform, it is something like _Docker Swarm on
steroids_ , and it is suposed to be used in large production environments. I did
not found a simple _hello world_ tutorial, as the simples example you can find
is still deploying a _pod_ that is being managed and escalated. It simply
doesn't make sense for a small site with some static pages (unless it is part of
thousands of small sites with static pages).

Some projects that are slightly related with this topic:

- [piku](https://github.com/piku/piku), a project deployment tool I checked some
  time ago (thanks to [Alex](https://github.com/4lejandrito)) similiar to
  Netlify.
- [ansible](https://github.com/ansible), and provisioning tool I used in Fujitsu
  to generate testing environments and locally to prepare my development
  environment.
