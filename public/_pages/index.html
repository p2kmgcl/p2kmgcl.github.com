<p>
  I am a developer who <strong>loves his job</strong>, aims for continuous learning, and is not afraid of learning from his mistakes. I have developed
  code for native interfaces, mobile interfaces and server-side execution but, without the slightest doubt, <strong>Front-End</strong> development is
  my main motivation as professional.
</p>

<p>
  I am a proficient <strong>Linux user</strong>, not only due to the comfort it gives to developers but also it's open and free nature. I like to
  support <strong>Open Source</strong> software: I consider it a great path for improvement, and a fantastic way to let others grow too.
</p>

<p>
  Working as part of a team feels the ideal situation for me. Although I can evolve fast by my own, I <strong>prefer to work together</strong> with
  great people to learn from, so we can get new skills from each other.
</p>

<p>
  I do <strong>like clean code</strong>, well-defined structure, and crystal clear documentation. I am <strong>meticulous</strong>, and I apply this
  behaviour to my projects: everytime I am able to, I like to apply generic solutions, like design patterns, and I put lots of effort to make the
  final product simple, legible and reusable.
