I am a developer who **loves his job**, aims for continuous learning, and is not
afraid of learning from his mistakes. I have developed code for native
interfaces, mobile interfaces and server-side execution but, without the
slightest doubt, **Front-End** development is my main motivation as
professional.

I am a proficient **Linux user**, not only due to the comfort it gives to
developers but also it's open and free nature. I like to support **Open Source**
software: I consider it a great path for improvement, and a fantastic way to let
others grow too.

Working as part of a team feels the ideal situation for me. Although I can
evolve fast by my own, I **prefer to work together** with great people to learn
from, so we can get new skills from each other.

I do **like clean code**, well-defined structure, and crystal clear
documentation. I am **meticulous**, and I apply this behaviour to my projects:
everytime I am able to, I like to apply generic solutions, like design patterns,
and I put lots of effort to make the final product simple, legible and reusable.
