## Summary

I am a passionate developer who always aims for getting more knowledge, besides
one of those who consider programming both a job and a hobby. As __GNU/Linux__
enthusiast and __Raspberry Pi__ owner, I like expetimenting with cutting edge
technologies like the ECMAScript 2016 standard, and I am never afraid of
starting a project from scratch.

While I am producing code every detail is important: I like keeping my source
code beautiful and easy to read, and I learn and apply __design patterns__
and __software development processes__ as often as I can.

I love programming languages that force a concrete style: like __Python__,
__Ruby__ and __CoffeeScript__. The last one is my favourite one, but always
understanding which is the final __JavaScript__ that is going to be used.
